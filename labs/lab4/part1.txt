a) The board is being implemented as a vector of 9 character strings

b) It makes class members inaccessible outside the class, but
the members can be accessed by any subclass of that class.

c)  if Grid size = 0
    if the puzzle is solved

d) No, the larger the puzzle, the longer the recursion will take

e) The neural network understands the cells in the 9x9 Sudoku grid as a graph,
 where the digits in the columns and rows are nodes.

 There are a total of 81 nodes, and each one is connected to another node if
 they lie on the same row and column.

 A recurrent RN is trained to send and receive messages between nodes that
 roughly translate to things like “I’m a 7, hence you can’t also be a 7”,
 so that it can work out by deduction what numbers fit where on the grid.
 It spits out a probability distribution for each digit to work out what
 number is most likely the correct fit for a particular cell. To train the
 model, the researchers generated a dataset containing 216,000 puzzles of
 varying difficulty. The easiest level had 34 out of 81 numbers already filled,
 and the hardest level had only 17 digits given.
